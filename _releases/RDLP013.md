Originally recorded on 4 track a few summers ago, these mellow and maudlin piano instrumentals will take you on a nostalgic trip. You can hear the summer heat gently pulling the strings in and out of tune as the tapes hisses and spins. Like a melted VHS that has been played a 1000 times these tunes will feel warm and familiar. Question Mark Band is a mystery to most, but it doesn't have to be that way.

Available in a limited run of 50 copies. Professionally duplicated
