Hailing from LaFayette Indiana, this amorphous psycho jazz unit drops a heavy slab of tunes that sounds like “the Glenn Miller orchestra recorded a tape for Industrial Records and microwaved the masters”. Hard to pin down and forever tripping with new players/ live sessions all over the US. This LP features: Drew Davis, Tim Gick, John Olson ( Wolf Eyes ), Jessica Billey, Jason Filer, Aaron Zernack, Paul Baldwin, and Zeno Ben-Amotz.

Available in a pressing of 500 copies
