Mutant vocals crash alongside sobering dada sentiments on this new LP by Fritz Welch (Peeesseye, FvRTvR, Ki, Lambs Gamble, Asparagus Piss Rain Drop, Ego Depletion, etc). Fritz presents a ping pong vocal dance that transforms into a twisted exchange of rhythms and melody. A recorded journey into the interior of Fritz’ brain hole. Unrelenting and beautiful in its execution across both sides, you’ll be gasping for air by the end of it all.

Available in a pressing of 300 copies. Green vinyl packaged in hand numbered, offset neon green covers designed by Reuben Lorch-Miller. Mastered by Sebastian Lexer. Recording and additional electronics by Andrew Barker.
