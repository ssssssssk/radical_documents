Radical Documents is pleased to present two trashy glam diamonds from L.A.’s Mother, Juggs & Speed. Unheard since 1989, these tracks were rescued from a tape found in the dusty garage of my friend and landlord Arthur Brennan. Think… The Dead Boys in a head on collision with the Ike and Tina Turner Revue. Featuring members of Glue and The Student Teachers. The results are shambolic… Warts, tape hiss, and all! Dedicated to the memory of lead singer and bon vivant Fred Maddux (1962- 1996)

Available in a limited pressing of 200 copies. Comes in B/W printed glue pocket sleeve.
