The second installment in an ongoing series by damaged Inglewood art rockers ATM. Still obscure, cult, and destined for the waste bin of historyâ€¦ but this time with slightly better production and half the songs are in spanish! This collection of tunes will definitely rid the party of narcs and normies, thinning the heard so the actual heads can get down!!! 

Available in a pressing of 300 copies. Comes packaged in Yellow Disco Jacket with custom sticker on front and back. Mastered by James Plotkin.
