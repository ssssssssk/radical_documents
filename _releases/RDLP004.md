Originally released as an extremely limited cassette in June 2014, this fantastic material is finally making its debut on vinyl. Recorded live on a hot summer afternoon in Ghent (using voice, guitar amplifier, and tape recorders) Sigtryggurâ€™s gorgeous ethereal moans seamlessly move between deep meditation and schizo rhythm. Not to be missed.

Available in a pressing of 200 copies
