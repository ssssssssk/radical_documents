Comprised of artists Tony Labat, Bruce Pollack, and Philip Huyser, The Puds were an exciting oddity nestled within the punk and performance community of San Francisco in the early 80â€™s. Known for their raucous live shows and for once performing inside a prison, the Puds only produced one recorded document in their short lifespan. Long out of print, it is now available for the first time in nearly 40 years. Two agitating and unnerving vocal cacophonies that will leave your head spinning. Audio has been taken and restored from the original tapes to produce this fantastic release. When you play it, wear it!

Available in a limited pressing of 200 copies. Comes in a two color
silkscreened dust jacket.
