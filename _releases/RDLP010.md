Replete with overtones, multiphonics, and free jazz spirit, Tiger Swallow Tail expands Ben Hall (The New Monuments) and Don Dietrich's (Borbetomagus, The New Monuments) sax and drum vocabulary into territories that border on raga and drone. The result is unrelenting noise bliss. From the first crack of the snare to the last snarling hiss of the reed.

Available in a limited pressing of 300 copies. Screen printed paste-on covers on red gloss jackets.
