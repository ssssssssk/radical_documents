From full throttle free jazz to intimate (sometimes guttural) microtonal vibrations, Barker and Irabagon stretch jazz to its limit on Anemone. The four tunes contained within are a fantastic showcase of Barker and Irabagonâ€™s brilliant knack for improvisation and their heightened sensitivity to their instruments (Drums and Tenor Sax). Recorded November 11th, 2019 by Andrew Barker in Brooklyn, NY.

Professionally produced CD. Limited to 200 copies.
