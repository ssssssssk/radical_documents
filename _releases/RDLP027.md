Artist duo Amy Howden-Chapman and Steve Kado return with a follow up to their debut album on Radical Documents. The side long pieces on 2 are sprawling and intense. The sound ranges from moments of stark minimalism to pulsing waves of modulation. The space in-between is bustling with intricate and understated moments that come at you from from all angles until the very last second. A beautiful advancement of LEAD's sound and vision.

Available in a limited pressing of 300 hand silkscreened copies.
