On “EE HEAD” Dean Spunt (No Age, Wives, C.R.A.S.H.) presents a musique concrete dish served in four parts. The ingredients for this record consist of a pre recorded palette of samples that are anchored by the occasional pounding kick drum and microphone feedback. Using these parameters, Dean gently weaves a through line across four separate (but eerily familiar) tracks by employing a motion sensor to trigger the samples at random. The themes begin to emerge and reverberate out across side A and B like heavily toasted versions of an original song that has been lost or buried by time.

*The inspiration for this record came from an initial performance of this piece at Gordon Robichaux Gallery (NY), September 16th, 2017

Available in a pressing of 250 copies. Mastered by Scott Cornish
