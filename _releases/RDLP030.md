"Cran Beret met every Tuesday of February and March 2018 to sit and improvise music. The recordings that became Heater were culled from and named for these sessions, during which an oversized Modine blower turned itself on from time to time to heat the studio. We are artists mostly but recommend giving music a try."

-- Anna Rosen and Elise Duryee-Browner
