"Recorded 2007-2019 in Beaverton, Oregon on a Tascam 424. NO COMPUTERS WERE USED TO CREATE THIS MUSIC‚Äù. 

This was the only text on a mysterious demo that showed up on our doorstep. I popped in the tape and was blown away. Blasted, treble soaked loner rock that sounded like it was pleading for help at the bottom of a well. Thankfully there was a phone number in the package. After a brief talk, where the label was sworn to secrecy, we decided to release this tape. 

Available in a limited run of 100 cassettes. Professionally duplicated.
