"Recorded 2007-2019 in Beaverton, Oregon on a Tascam 424. NO COMPUTERS WERE USED TO CREATE THIS MUSIC‚Äù. 

This was the only text on a mysterious demo that showed up on our doorstep. I popped in the tape and was blown away. Blasted, treble soaked loner rock that sounded like it was pleading for help at the bottom of a well. Thankfully there was a phone number in the package. After a brief talk, where the label was sworn to secrecy, we decided to release this tape. 

UPDATE: the intial run of 100 cassettes is now sold out. We have decided to make this release available on vinyl. Limited to 500 copies. Pressed in the USA at Erika Records. LP's will ship 03/1/2021.
